## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure
- **CSS** – Styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Logic & interactivity

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Arrays & Objects
- Functions
- Conditions (`if / else`)
- Array methods (`filter`, `forEach`)
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Listeners
- Browser `localStorage`

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects inside an array
- Each task has:
  - `id`
  - `text`
  - `completed` status
- The UI updates dynamically based on user actions
- Tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Build interactive web apps using pure JavaScript
- Manage application state without frameworks
- Handle real-world UI logic like filtering and persistence

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Edit task feature
- Task counter
- Active filter highlighting
- Dark mode
